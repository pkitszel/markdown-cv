## About me
I like analytic challenges, algorithmic tasks, system design, troubleshooting.
I strive to be accurate and focus on the right problem, yet I easily immerse myself in technical details.
Tasks that require more time to accomplish don't bore me.
I always look for opportunities to build deep understanding of new technologies.
I find myself very efficient both when dealing with my work solo and when working in a group, what makes a great opportunity to grow thanks to each other.

### Specialized in
C, C++, scripting (bash, awk), git, Linux, algorithms, go.

## Experience

# Intel - NIC Driver Dev

`since APR 2022`

I'm a **Maintainer** of our upstream Ethernet drivers since June 2024.

I develop mostly in C, mostly for our 100G NIC driver, both upstream and out-of-tree (OOT).
Examples: extend devlink resources API to allow user managing NIC resources between PF and VF (WIP).
Refactor devlink fmsg API to retain errors.

On top of lots of bugfixes and being a main reviewer in the org, I did multiple process and scripting (bash, awk) contributions that enabled the team to work better.
Most proud of kcompat-generator (for OOT, all drivers), the tool to abstract away the growing difference between each supported (distro) kernel.

Bug reports and fixes to outside projects.
