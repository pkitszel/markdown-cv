## About me
I like analytic challenges, algorithmic tasks, system design, troubleshooting. I always strive to be accurate and focus on the right problem, yet I easily immerse myself in a technical details. Tasks that require more time to accomplish don't bore me. I find myself very efficient both working in a group and when dealing with my work solo. I also look for opportunities to build deep understanding of new technologies.
